<h2>Message from the author</h2>
<footer>I have been interested in Dragon Ball Z since i first watched it back in 2003. The charachters are so unique and have so much depth to them that is why I can speak for all dragon ball fans that this is the best anime/manga ever. The battles bring you in and the story lines stay with us forever no matter how old we get. Not only has it changed the lives of millions but it continues to be the base for alot of new animes that come out today.</footer>

  <h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Dragon ball is a manga series that was created by Akira Toriyama in 1984. The story revolves around a charachter named Goku and his adventures on wanting to get stronger and stronger. The manga was based off of the Chinese novel Journey to the West which revolves around the monkey king which Goku is based off.
The story has been changed to fit his new creation but used the same template as the novel. With this Toriyama was able to explore new settings that wasn't used in manga at that time. The manga shows many traits of Chinese culture down to the different fighting moves and even the robe that Goku wears. Toriyama also incorporated influences from his home country Japan. In 1986 the first anime adaptation of Dragon ball aired in Japan boosting its popularity.
In 1989 Toriyama decided to continue the manga by making his charachters all grown up, the title was Dragon ball Z. Because of Toriyama's specfifc sense of humor; it was harder to bring the show to the states because amwrican audiences didn't connect with the show. The first peice of dragnon ball media to make it to the states was an NES game but it was stripped of its licence before arrival stripping the game of its original content; they named it Dragonpower.
The very next year America got its first tatse of the Dragon ball anime but only about 5 test episodes were released but was quicly cancelled. After FUNnimation bought the rights to Dragon ball they decided to skip to Dragon ball Z which they thought would translate better with Americans. As the show was aired they would take out specific scenes to better comply with the audience. After only two seasons of aring FUNnimation pulled the plug. This could have been the end of Dragon Ball Z in the states. On August 31, 1998 Dragon ball Z first aired on Cartoon Networks's Toonami which was one of Americas first showcases of different animes. Ratings went through the roof which made FUNnimation bring the rest of the series to the US. Today Dragon Ball still aires on Toonami with the right to offical be uncut which means the US cannot change the origibal script. Since then the series has been widely loved and seen as one of the gratest manga and anime of all time.</p>
